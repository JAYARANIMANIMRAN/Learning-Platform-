Java and JDBC connectivity
The Online Learning Platform is a user-friendly digital solution designed to make quality education 
accessible to learners worldwide. It offers features like course registration, personalized dashboards, 
multimedia content, and progress tracking, providing an engaging and interactive learning 
experience. 

Developed using Java, JDBC, and MySQL, the platform ensures secure data management and 
scalability. It caters to diverse learning needs, enabling seamless interaction between learners,
